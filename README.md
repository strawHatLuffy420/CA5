To run a Docker Compose stack using images from Docker Hub, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Docker Compose File**: Obtain the Docker Compose file that defines your application stack. You can find this file in your project's repository on a platform like GitHub.

2. **Pull Docker Images from Docker Hub**: Before running the stack, ensure that the required Docker images are available on Docker Hub. Use the `docker-compose pull` command to download the images from Docker Hub to your local environment.

3. **Run the Docker Compose Stack**: Use the `docker-compose up` command to start your Docker Compose stack. The services will be created and run according to the configurations defined in the Compose file.

4. **Access Your Application**: Once the stack is up and running, you can access your application through a web browser or other appropriate client. The application should be accessible using the defined network and port configurations.

These steps will allow you to deploy and run a Docker Compose stack using pre-existing images from Docker Hub, ensuring that your application runs smoothly in a containerized environment.
